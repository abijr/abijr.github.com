Generally before I start doing programming, debugging, etc., I fire up a new terminal. Most of the time, I've got a terminal laying around somewhere, so why not make it display some useful info? On this post I'm going to describe how I got my PS1 to display git status information (such as modified, deleted or unstaged files, current branch, and number of commits ahead of upstream).
