      <description>The three general build systems from the big players. Bazel by Google, Pants by Twitter and Buck by Facebook, all attempt to allay the problems plaguing build system since time immemorial. They are all based on the internal build system from Google, Blaze, and as such, they are almost identical in features. They improve on the correctness, speed and modularity of the builds with features such as sandboxed builds, caching of targets, and namespacing of build modules.</description>

 When applications/services crash, they crash&amp;hellip; hard. No graceful failures, reason being that, there is only one instance of each application/service.</description>
